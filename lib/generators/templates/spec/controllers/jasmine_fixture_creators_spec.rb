  You can use this file to define new Jasmine Fixtures
  or
  You can add jasmine fixtures spec on your controllers spec or functionals tests

  We have provided an example for you to crib off.

  Basically:
  1) Visit a route with your controller action
  2) Make sure response.body has the content you want become fixture
  3) save_fixture with the response you want and give a name to your fixture


Using save_fixture method
-------------------------

save_fixture('content', 'file_name.html') => will create a file called file_name.html on spec/javascripts/fixtures

html_for('body') =>  will take only the content of <body> tag and will rename <body> to <div>
                     to avoid nested <body> tags within the Jasmine runner

If you have custom responses (ajax partials, JSON, etc),
you can subvert this and use response.body or whatever is appropriate.

####Examples

#Rspec

describe UsersController do
  #You need to render_views in each of your describes to get the content of the response
  render_views

  describe "user signup" do
    #Example of a standard request that would use html_for to strip <body>
    it "generates a new user signup page" do
      get :new
      response.should be_success
      save_fixture(html_for('body'), 'user-signup-page.html')
    end

    #Example of an ajax request that doesn't have a body tag to strip out
    describe "a user's profile" do
      it "generates successful signup xhr response" do
        xhr :post, :create, :user => { :name => 'Bob', :password => 'something', :password_confirmation => 'something' }
        response.should be_success
        save_fixture(response.body, 'user-success-ajax-response')
      end
    end
  end
end

#Funtionals

class UsersControllerTest < ActionController::TestCase

   #Example of a standard request that would use html_for to strip <body>
   test "GET#new generates a new user signup page" do
      get :new
      assert_response :success
      save_fixture(html_for('body'), 'user-signup-page')
   end

   #Example of an ajax request that doesn't have a body tag to strip out
   test "ajax POST#create generates successful signup response" do
      post :create, :user => { :name => 'Bob', :password => 'something', :password_confirmation => 'something' }, :format => :js
      assert_response :success
      save_fixture(response.body, 'user-success-ajax-response')
   end
end
